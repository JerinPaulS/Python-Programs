516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
