'''
Count triplets with sum smaller than X
Given an array arr[] of distinct integers of size N and a value sum, the task is to find the count of triplets (i, j, k), having (i<j<k) with the sum of (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k]) smaller than the given value sum.


Example 1:


Input: N = 4, sum = 2
arr[] = {-2, 0, 1, 3}
Output:  2
Explanation: Below are triplets with 
sum less than 2 (-2, 0, 1) and (-2, 0, 3). 
 

Example 2:


Input: N = 5, sum = 12
arr[] = {5, 1, 3, 4, 7}
Output: 4
Explanation: Below are triplets with 
sum less than 12 (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), 
(1, 3, 7) and (1, 4, 5).

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You don't need to take any input, as it is already accomplished by the driver code. You just need to complete the function countTriplets() that take array arr[], integer N  and integer sum as parameters and returns the count of triplets.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N2).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
3 ≤ N ≤ 103
-103 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 103

            while j < k:
                if arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] >= sumo:
                    k = k - 1
                else:
                    result = result + k - j
                    j = j + 1
        return result
